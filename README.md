# Vanilla JS "Who's that Pokémon?" Game

This game uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to create a multiple-choice "Who's 
that Pokémon?" Game!

The data from the API includes `.png` sprites for each Pokémon that we can use to create 
a CSS silhouette with a brightness filter rule: `filter: brightness(0);`.

This game also explores the use of the `speechSynthesis` interface to speak the correct 
answer once a choice has been selected.
